This task is about performing **sentiment analysis** on customer reviews to identify positive or negative sentiments and extract insights.<br>
I've used Python libraries and techniques like:<br>
- pandas for data frames
- Numpy for performing statical calculates
- matplotlib for visuals
- TextBlob for sentiment lexicons.
